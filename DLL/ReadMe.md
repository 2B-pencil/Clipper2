# Clipper2 DLL

The Clipper2 library is written in several languages (C++, C# & Delphi Pascal) and can be compiled and linked directly into applications using any one of those languages. Now developers who use other programming languages can also access almost all of Clipper2's features using a C++ compiled dynamically linked library. And because the C++ code is significantly faster than either C# or Delphi, developers using those languages may also prefer using the DLL when performance is critical.

This folder contains: 
1.   C++ code that compiles **Clipper2** into Windows DLLs (both 32bit and 64bit).
2.   Several sample applications that demonstrate how to use these DLLs in non-C++ languages.
