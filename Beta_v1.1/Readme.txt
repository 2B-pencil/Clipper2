The code in this folder is an early preview of Clipper2 ver 1.1.

Although this folder is named Beta_v1.1, it's still too buggy to use. 
(The Delphi version is mostly OK but the C++ translation is not.)

Anyhow, the main difference between ver 1.0 and 1.1 is a complete rewrite of merging polygons in clipping solutions. 
This was very convoluted in ver 1.0 and was going to be difficult to maintain.
This new code is much simpler and should be at least as effective in merging touching polygons as the older code.

Hopefully I'll have most of the bugs ironed out in the next few weeks. Stay tuned :).
