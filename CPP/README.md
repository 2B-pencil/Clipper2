# Clipper2 C++

CAUTION: <br>
I'm not a C++ programmer so forgive my idiosyncratic programming style here. Undoubtedly I will have done things that are odd or wrong or whatever. Please let me know so I can correct them. Things like Makefiles are beyond me and I'm hope others will contribute so Clipper2 C++ will more easily compile in environments other than MS Visual Studio. Also, this is my first draft and hasn't been heavily tested.<br><br>
